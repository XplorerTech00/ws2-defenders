# AI Incident Response, V1.0 -- DRAFT

## 1. Abstract
This paper addresses the topic of incident response in the context of AI systems. As with other materials produced by the Coalition for Secure AI, this paper focuses on technological capabilities and gaps that are specific to the field of articifical intelligence and does not address the topic of incident response in other contexts as this has been well-researched and documented by existing frameworks (such as [NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf). When AI systems are attacked and compromised, what are the specific steps that a defender should take to maximize auditability, resiliency, recovery, and hardening against the (successful) exploitation workflow? What proactive steps should a defender take to minimize the possibility of successful exploitation to begin with? Does the notion of a forensic investigation carry weight in AI Incident Response? Given that AI systems can put downward pressure on "explainability", does this tend to impact the effectiveness of IR activities? To what extent do agentic AI architectures complicate incident response, and are there specific steps to minimize or account for this complexity? These are examples of the types of questions that this paper will address.
